LSP stands for Liskov Substitution Principle.

Points come out:
1. Never use inheritance for code reuse.
2. Use inheritance only and only if there is a strict 'is a/an' relation.
like --> FullTime is an employee, Intern is an employee but Volunteer is not an employee

Definition: Subtype must be substitutable for their base type.

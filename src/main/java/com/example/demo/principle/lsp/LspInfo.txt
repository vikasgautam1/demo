LSP stands for Liskov Substitution Principle.

Points come out:
1. Never use inheritance for code reuse.
2. Use inheritance only and only if there is a strict 'is a/an' relation.
like --> FullTime is an employee, Intern is an employee but Volunteer is not an employee

Definition: Subtype must be substitutable for their base type.

So the implementation of Volunteer Employee is wrong. Volunteer should not come under employee.
Create multiple interfaces if needed, this is what this principle stats.
Please see cricketGameSimulator for this principle.
